block.infinitodustry-armored-junction.details = Hunger for invention of (a lot) more durable distribution components could come at a close when in testing areas some bots could forge Vector to allow for a durable-ish piece of equipment that could almost replace Junction.

block.infinitodustry-armored-sorter.details = After finding out you can make Junction out of tougher material than Copper, efforts were made for making other block variants [scarlet](including routers)[]. And oddly enough, putting in 3 doors and a sensor is much easier to peform with Vector (while still, perseving the structural integrity what is strived) than the same being expected than, lets say, Thorium.
