block.infinitodustry-armored-junction.details = Hunger for invention of (a lot) more durable distribution components could come at a close when in testing areas some bots could forge Vector to allow for a durable-ish piece of equipment that could almost replace Junction.

block.infinitodustry-armored-router-large.details = As if usage of Armored Routers wasn't enough as a margin of insanity, Armored Distributor are a thing now, too. Damn that Vector could have been spent for much better stuff.

block.infinitodustry-armored-sorter.details = After finding out you can make Junction out of tougher material than Copper, efforts were made for making other block variants [scarlet](including routers)[]. And oddly enough, putting in 3 doors and a sensor is much easier to peform with Vector (while still, perseving the structural integrity what is strived) than the same being expected than, lets say, Thorium.
block.infinitodustry-armored-sorter-invert.details = Regardless of what is used to create sorters, simillar stuff will be used in order to create the invert variant. It ain't a new thing, really.

block.infinitodustry-armored-transporter.details = After all basic distribution components gained their plated variant, next up were the bridges.

Until knowledge about Matrix became a thing, then the same story happened as with Junctions. Except it was more time-consuming and expensive.
block.infinitodustry-armored-yeeter.name = Armored Liquid Bridge
